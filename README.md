Paws and Preferences website to choose the cats you like or dislike.

## About This Project

This is a React application built with Vite, allowing users to swipe through cat profiles and indicate their preferences by liking or disliking them. The project is hosted on GitHub Pages, and the source code is available in the repository.

## React + Vite Setup

This project uses a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
